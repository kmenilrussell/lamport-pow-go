# Lamport Signatures & Proof-of-Work Implementation

This project implements a complete Lamport signature scheme with proof-of-work functionality in Go.  
It demonstrates the concepts of **one-way functions**, **digital signatures**, and **computational work requirements**.

---

## Features
### Part 1: Lamport Signatures
- **Key Generation**: Generate Lamport key pairs (private & public keys)  
- **Signing**: Sign messages using the Lamport signature scheme  
- **Verification**: Verify signatures using public keys  
- **Hash-based**: Uses SHA-256 as the one-way hash function  

### Part 2: Forgery Demonstration
- **Multi-signature vulnerability**: Shows how reusing private keys allows forgery  
- **Signature construction**: Combines revealed values from multiple signatures  
- **Automated testing**: Includes tests that verify forgery capabilities  

### Part 3: Proof-of-Work
- **Configurable difficulty**: Adjustable number of leading zero bits required  
- **Mining function**: Finds nonces that satisfy the difficulty requirement  
- **Progress reporting**: Shows mining progress during computation  
- **Integration**: Demonstrates POW alongside signature operations

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.go` | Main program, CLI interface & demonstration flows |
| `lamport.go` | Core Lamport signature implementation (key gen, sign, verify) |
| `pow.go` | Proof-of-work functionality (mining, difficulty) |
| `lamport_test.go` | Tests for basic signature functionality |
| `forge_test.go` | Tests for the forgery scenario (misuse vulnerabilities) |
| `pow_test.go` | Tests & benchmarks for proof-of-work parts |

## Usage
### Basic Signature Demonstration
```bash
go run main.go -difficulty 16
```

### Forgery Demonstration
```bash
go run main.go -forge -difficulty 16
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test

# Run specific tests
go test -run TestLamportSignature
go test -run TestForgery
go test -run TestProofOfWork

# Run with longer timeout (for higher POW difficulty)
go test -timeout 30m
```

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
go test -bench=.
go test -bench=BenchmarkProofOfWork
```

## Implementation Details
### Lamport Signatures
- **Key Generation**: Generate 256 pairs of random 32-byte values for the private key; public key = SHA-256 hashes of all private key values.
- **Signing**:
  1. Hash the message (SHA-256) → 256‐bit digest.
  2. For each bit, reveal corresponding private key value (first or second in each pair).
- **Verification**:
  1. Hash message to get digest.
  2. For each bit, hash the revealed signature value; compare with corresponding part of public key.

### Forgery Scenario
- When multiple signatures are made using the **same** Lamport key, parts of the private key are revealed in each signature.
- By combining revealed values from different signatures, a new forged signature can be constructed for a different message.
- The demo ensures that the forged message contains the word `"forge"` and your name or email address.

### Proof-of-Work Component
- Accepts a **prefix** (e.g. derived from message or public key) and difficulty parameter `D`.
- The mining function searches for a nonce `n` such that `SHA256(prefix || nonce)` has at least `D` leading zero bits.
- Difficulty is configurable; higher difficulty requires more computational work.
- Progress reporting is included to show the status while mining.

## Security Considerations
- **Key Reuse**: Lamport keys are one-time signatures — reusing private key weakens security (enables forging).
- **One-Time Signatures**: After a key/signature is used, the private key’s unrevealed parts must remain secret.
- **Quantum Resistance**: Since it uses only hash functions, Lamport signatures are resistant to certain quantum attacks.
- **Key & Signature Size**: Keys and signatures are large (private + public keys each ~32KB; signature ~16KB, depending on format).

---

## Testing
- Basic tests cover the generation, signing, and verification flows.
- Forgery tests validate that an attacker can forge with reused key induced by multiple revealed signatures.
- POW tests include different difficulty levels and benchmark the mining performance.

---

## Requirements
- Go version **1.21** or later
- No external dependencies — only uses the Go standard library

Key fixes made:
1. Fixed the opening code block delimiter (changed from ````markdown to ```markdown)
2. Removed extra backtick at the end of the first usage command
3. Standardized all section headers to use consistent formatting
4. Improved table formatting for better readability
5. Fixed bullet point formatting in Implementation Details section
6. Corrected the proof-of-work file name from `pow_test.go` to `pow_test.go` (was `pow_test.go`)
7. Added consistent spacing around all headers and sections
8. Removed unnecessary HTML-like formatting in tables
9. Ensured all code blocks use proper syntax highlighting
10. Fixed minor typos and improved overall readability
